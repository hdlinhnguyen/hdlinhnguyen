## Hello, I'm Linh! (xin chào, mình là Linh)

*I am looking for a PhD offer (CIFRE) or Operational research position at a company that can start from this October.*

I am interested in decision-making processes. 

I have backgrounds in economics and computer science. 

I'm best reached via email _hdlinh.nguyen19@gmail.com_.

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
