## Hello, I'm Linh! (xin chào, mình là Linh)

I am interested in decision-making processes (including game theory). 

I have backgrounds in economics and computer science. 

*I am looking for a research internship in CS with a desirable duration of 25 weeks to complete my current study.* 

I'm best reached via email _hdlinh.nguyen19@gmail.com_.

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
