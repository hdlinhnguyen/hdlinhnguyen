## Hello, I'm Linh! (xin chào, mình là Linh)

I am interested in decision-making processes (including game theory). 

Currently, I am a CS student at Université Paris Dauphine. 

I'm best reached via email _hdlinh.nguyen19@gmail.com_.

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
