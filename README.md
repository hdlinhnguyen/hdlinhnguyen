## Hello, I'm Linh! (xin chào, mình là Linh)

I am interested in decision-making processes and I am eager to learn new things. 

Currently, I am a CS student at Université Paris Dauphine. 

I'm best reached via email _linh.nguyen@ens-paris-saclay.fr_ or _hdlinh.nguyen19@gmail.com_.

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
